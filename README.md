# shelley-agent

A Clawdbot skill to interact with Shelley, the coding agent running on exe.dev VMs.

## What is this?

This skill allows Clawdbot to programmatically:
- Spawn new Shelley chat sessions
- Send prompts/instructions to Shelley
- Wait for task completion
- Retrieve results

All sessions are stored in the VM and visible at `https://<your-vm>.exe.xyz:9999/` or `https://<your-vm>.shelley.exe.xyz`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run a simple task
./shelley-cli run "What is 2+2?"

# Run a task in a specific directory
./shelley-cli run "List all Python files" --cwd /home/exedev/projects

# Create a conversation (non-blocking)
./shelley-cli new "Build a REST API" --cwd /home/exedev
# Returns: {"conversation_id": "cXXXXXXX", "status": "accepted"}

# Check status
./shelley-cli status cXXXXXXX

# Get result when done
./shelley-cli result cXXXXXXX
```

## Use Cases

- **Delegation**: Clawdbot can delegate complex coding tasks to Shelley
- **Parallel Work**: Start multiple Shelley sessions for different tasks
- **Automation**: Script interactions with Shelley for CI/CD or scheduled tasks
- **Audit Trail**: All sessions are logged and viewable in the Shelley UI
